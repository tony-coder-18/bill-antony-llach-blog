At my job we use Visual Studio 2022 as main IDE. I had this issue about not being able to see all the words at the same time in my laptop.

I solved it by hitting
```
ctrl + E + W
```
in the currently opened document.

In this way I could look at all the code at the same time, which made a better developer experience for me.

I hope it's useful for you also.

S.D.G.
